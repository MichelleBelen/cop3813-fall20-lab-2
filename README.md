# Lab 2: Asynchronous Fun
## The purpose:

The purpose of this lab is to learn about the different ways of working asynchronously with JS code, and the pros/cons of each.

## The challenge:

Write an app that gathers feedback from the user using the command line. Process that feedback by logging the information to the command line.  Finally, log a statement showing that your feedback session is finished. Include the length of the comment that the user entered.

You should also output the date/time every five seconds to prove that the app is capable of doing something else while waiting for the user's input.

## The solution:

We will be solving this challenge four different ways: synchronously, using callbacks, using promises, and using async/await.
